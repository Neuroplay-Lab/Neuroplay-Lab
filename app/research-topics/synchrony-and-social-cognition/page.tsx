                    People regularly move in time with one another. We sing,
                    dance and even walk in time with those around us. A great
                    deal of work has now shown that moving in time together has
                    pro-social consequences, such as increasing liking, rapport,
                    and cooperation towards co-actors. However, these social
                    effects of coordination go beyond the pro-social.
                    Coordination also has a dark side leading people to be more
                    likely to comply with the destructive requests of our
                    co-actors. Our work in this area explores how, why and when
                    coordination has the social consequences it does.
                </p>
                <p className="my-2">
                    Through various quantitative and mixed methods studies, this
                    research highlights how coordination may lead to co-actors
                    identifying as common group members, which explains the
                    social consequences coordination has and why it has them.
                    This group formation framework explains how coordination
                    leads to various socio-cognitive consequences by leading
                    individuals to view themselves and their co-actors in common
                    group terms. This leads to an individual’s sense of self
                    becoming temporarily diluted as an interdependent identity
                    becomes more salient, thus leading to a range of pro-group
                    consequences.

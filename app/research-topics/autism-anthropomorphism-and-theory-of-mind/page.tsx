                    Anthropomorphism, or seeing the non-human human, is one of
                    our most natural social inclinations. By making the
                    non-human human, we can better predict and understand
                    behaviours, as we are ‘familiarising’ the unfamiliar. In
                    this way, anthropomorphising is essentially an extension of
                    theory of mind. Given this connection, many researchers have
                    proposed that autistic people may not anthropomorphise as
                    much as non-autistic people. However, a great deal of work
                    now shows that this is not the case. Autistic people engage
                    in anthropomorphism at the same or even a greater extent
                    than non-autistic people. A growing body of research shows
                    that they may be better at taking the perspective of
                    anthropomorphic agents.

                    of this topic uncovered a clear link between autism and
                    anthropomorphism. We found that autistic individuals showed
                    a penchant for anthropomorphic characters and agents,
                    suggesting a possible strength in interacting with and
                    evaluating these agents.

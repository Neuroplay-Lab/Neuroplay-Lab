                    Much of our research aims to improve social outcomes for
                    autistic people of all ages. Some of this work has focused
                    on understanding how quality of life outcomes can be
                    enhanced for autistic people, particularly those with a
                    later-in-life diagnosis. Other work, following on from our
                    finding that autistic people are interested in the
                    non-human, has explored how human-animal contact can benefit
                    autistic people.

                    and how these can be harnessed to better include autistic
                    people in the community and even improve the social
                    connection between autistic and non-autistic people.

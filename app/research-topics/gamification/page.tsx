                    Games are one of the social building blocks of early
                    development. As well as improving cognitive skills like
                    planning, inhibition control and maths games teach us
                    cooperation and joint attention and help us sharpen our
                    theory of mind skills (like strategizing and bluffing). Our
                    work mainly focuses on how games also improve social skills
                    and how this can benefit autistic people. We are interested
                    not only in the effects of gaming but the reasons why
                    certain people may be drawn to the hobby.

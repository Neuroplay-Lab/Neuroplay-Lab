people with neurocognitive disorders and healthy seniors, with a particular focus on remote/hybrid workshops, in which at least a part of the participants is connected remotely. recommendations were gathered using a delphi methodology. the expert panel (n = 18) included experts in the health, art and/or board games domains. they answered questions via two rounds of web-surveys, and then discussed the results in a plenary meeting. some of the questions were also shared with the general public (n = 101). both the experts and the general public suggested that organizing workshops in a hybrid format (some face-to-face sessions, some virtual session) is feasible and interesting for people with neurocognitive disorders. we reported guidelines on the overall structure of workshops, practical tips on how to organize remote workshops, and a swot analysis of the use of remote/hybrid workshops. the guidelines may be employed by clinicians to decide, based on their needs and constraints, what interventions and what kind of workshop format to employ, as well as by researcher to standardize procedures to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for people with neurocognitive disorders."}, {"id": "5ed5931b2667b976c0016c4d518a850a", "title": "Reading the mind in cartoon eyes: Comparing human versus cartoon emotion recognition in those with high and low levels

judging the mental states of anthropomorphic characters. this review highlights that while individuals with asd traditionally show deficits on a wide range of tom tests, such as recognizing facial emotions, such tom deficits may be ameliorated if the stimuli presented is cartoon or animal-like rather than in human form. individuals with asd show a greater interest in anthropomorphic characters and process the features of these characters using methods typically reserved for human stimuli. personal accounts of individuals with asd also suggest they may identify more closely with animals than

dimensions along which explanations might vary. first, pro-social effects might require in-phase synchrony or simply coordination. second, the effects of rhythmic movements on cooperation might be direct or mediated by an intervening variable. third, the pro-social effects might occur in proportion to the quality of the coordination, or occur once some threshold amount of coordination has occurred. we report an experiment and two follow-ups which sought to identify which classes of models are required to account for the positive effects of coordinated rhythmic movement on cooperation. across the studies, we found evidence (1) that coordination, and not just synchrony, can have pro-social consequences (so long as the social nature of the task is perceived), (2) that the effects of intentional coordination are direct, not mediated, and (3) that the degree of the coordination did not predict the degree of cooperation. the fact of inter-personal coordination (moving together in
